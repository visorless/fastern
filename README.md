The mission is to build a small web app in the FARM stack.
Its going to be something like a simple small business application,
perhaps with inventory and customer management.
It’s not going to be fancy in any regard, but it will serve as a platform for people that know nothing about Flask,
or web development or web apps to get started from.

I will preface this whole thing saying that there is going to be very little focus on security.
I am by no means a security expert, and to keep things simple, I’ll just focus on the basics of the whole thing.

I will focus at first on getting Flask running with Apache, because that seems like a poorly documented setup on the Internet.
I know, I know, I should just use Nginx with Flask! 
I agree there, setting up Nginx, Gunicorn and Flask together is easier than getting Apache up and running with flask.
But, recently in my professional life, I had the requirement of using Apache, so it was an interesting challenge to get this up and working.
